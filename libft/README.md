# libft

The **libft** project builds on the concepts I learned during Day-06 of the bootcamp ie code a library of useful functions that I'll be allowed to reuse in most of your C projects this year. This will save me a lot of precious time. The following assignments will have me write lines of code I already wrote during the bootcamp.

### Objectives
C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project makes me to take the time to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help me for all my future C projects. Through this project, 42 also give me the opportunity to expand the list of functions
with my own. I'll expand my libft throughout the year.
